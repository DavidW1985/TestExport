# Emigration Assessment Platform

## Overview

This is a React-based web application that provides AI-powered emigration assessment services with expert review. The platform uses a 6-question initial assessment form followed by intelligent follow-up questions generated by ChatGPT. The system categorizes user responses into 10 structured categories (goal, finance, family, housing, work, immigration, education, tax, healthcare, other, outstanding_clarifications) and guides users through up to 3 rounds of targeted follow-up questions before connecting them with emigration experts.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React 18 and TypeScript, using a modern component-based architecture. The UI leverages shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives for accessibility and consistent design patterns. The application uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing and TanStack Query for efficient server state management and API interactions.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **React Hook Form with Zod validation**: Provides robust form handling with schema-based validation for the assessment form
- **Tailwind CSS with CSS variables**: Enables consistent theming and responsive design across all components
- **Component composition pattern**: Uses Radix UI primitives wrapped in custom components for maximum flexibility and reusability

### Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript. The architecture separates concerns through a clean service layer pattern with dedicated modules for routing, storage abstraction, and business logic.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Express.js with TypeScript**: Provides type safety and modern JavaScript features for the server
- **Storage abstraction layer**: Uses an interface-based approach that currently implements in-memory storage but can easily be swapped for database persistence
- **Middleware-first approach**: Implements logging, error handling, and request parsing through Express middleware

### Data Management
The application uses Drizzle ORM for database schema definition and management, configured for PostgreSQL. The schema is shared between client and server for type consistency, with Zod schemas providing runtime validation.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Shared schema approach**: Database schema and validation schemas are co-located in a shared directory for consistency
- **Drizzle ORM**: Provides type-safe database queries and migrations with excellent TypeScript integration
- **Zod validation**: Ensures data integrity at both API boundaries and form submission

### Development Environment
The project uses Vite for fast development builds and hot module replacement. The monorepo structure keeps related code together while maintaining clear separation of concerns between client, server, and shared modules.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Vite build system**: Optimizes development experience with fast HMR and efficient production builds
- **Monorepo structure**: Enables code sharing while maintaining clear module boundaries
- **TypeScript throughout**: Provides end-to-end type safety from database to UI components
